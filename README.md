# Simple Weapon Box 

Simple Weapon Box is a Garry's Mod addon designed for server owners and administrators, offering new roleplay possibilities. It is ideal for temporary events or as a simple armory.

This addon adds a weapon box tool with two configurable modes that can be combined:

- **Limited Supply Mode**: Restricts the number of weapons players can retrieve from a specific weapon box.
- **Random Supply Mode**: Makes the weapon box drop random weapons from a predefined list.

By default, the weapon box allows players to choose and take as many weapons as they want from the list specified during spawning. However, you can mix both modes to create a weapon box that is both limited supply and random supply.
